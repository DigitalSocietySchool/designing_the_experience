# The HIVE Co-creation Toolkit
This is the website to go alongside The HIVE Co-creation project created at MediaLABAmsterdam.

# The Project
This toolkit consists of a set of tools, which museum professionals need to set up their first co-creation, such as instructions, activity cards, a game board and a website. The Hive will help museum professionals to get engaged with their community and improve museum experiences.

# Using this Repository
This is a distributable version of the website created using Adobe Muse - as such you cannot directly import this project into Muse for further editing. Any further modifications will need to be made on the markup and stylesheets themselves.
